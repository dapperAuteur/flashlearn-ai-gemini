# Flashcard AI Pro: The Today I L.E.A.R.N.T. Show (TIL.Show)

**Version:** 1.2
**Status:** In Development

Welcome to Flashcard AI Pro, a mobile-first, AI-powered Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to make learning more efficient and effective. This application automates flashcard creation from various sources and uses machine learning to create optimized study schedules, allowing users to focus on what matters most: learning.

## The Problem
